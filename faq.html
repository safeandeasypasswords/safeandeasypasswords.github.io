                What is a password strategy?
                <div id="faq1" class="FAA">
               A password strategy is a mental algorithm that you can use to generate your passwords on the fly, i.e., you don't need to memorize
                    passwords anymore! Whenever you need to type a password you can simply run an algorithm in your head with no need for paper or pencil.
                    Click on <a href="threeWordSchema.html"> Three Word Strategy </a> to see an example of
                    such a strategy.

               Why should I use a password strategy?
                <div id="faq2" class="FAA">
                    If all your accounts have the same password,
                    the adversary that knows the password to your facebook account can also login to your bank account.
                    Using password strategies, you generate a unique password for each website.
                    It does greatly increase your security. And you do not have to memorize or write down any of your passwords.
               <!--  Security of online information is summarized in passwords. The number of online accounts that we use is increasing
                    rapidly and memorizing different passwords is not feasible anymore. To avoid this difficulty, people either share
                    the same password between multiple accounts or they use password manager apps. It has been seen that both of these methods
                    are vulnerable to security threats. As a solution, we propose use of simple mental algorithms which we call password schemas.
                    Our algorithms have proven security guarantees. -->

                Do I need to memorize passwords for different websites?
                <div id="faq3" class="FAA">
                No! Everytime that you want to login to a website, you will generate/regenerate your password using your password strategy, i.e., mental algorithm.

            <div class="FAQ" onclick="toggle('faq4')">
                What if I don't use a website for a few months? Will I still remember the password?
                <div id="faq4" class="FAA">
                You don't have to remember your password, you can easily regenerate it in your head.

                If I want to adopt a password strategy, I would have to change all of my current passwords, this is a lot of effort!
                Why should I do this?
                <div id="faq5" class="FAA">
                The initial effort to adopt our password strategies might seem high.
                    However, you don't need to change all your passwords in one shot,
                    you can change the password for a website the next time you want to login to the website.
                    Once you adopt it for your accounts,
                    it will make your life much easier for the following reasons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your passwords will resemble a random combination of letters/numbers and therefore will be very hard to crack.</li>
                        <li>You don't need to remember any of your passwords.</li>
                        <li>You don't even need to know if you have an account with a website! Generate your password with your algorithm,
                            if it works, you have an account, otherwise create an account with the same password that you just generated.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you want to make a new account, you don't need to design a new password. Just give the name of the website/app 
                        as input to your algorithm and generate a password.
                        </li>
                        <li>No "forgot my password" anymore!</li>

            <div class="FAQ" onclick="toggle('faq6')">
                These strategies are public, why are my passwords secure?
                <div id="faq6" class="FAA">
                Although the strategies are public, your mental algorithm uses a private key that only you know. It is a mathematically
                    proven fact that if you chose your key randomly (not based on your personal information),
                    your passwords will be hard to crack.

                How difficult is it for an adversary to hack into my accounts?
                <div id="faq7" class="FAA">
                It depends on the strategy that you use. For example,
                    if you use the <a href="http://safeandeasypasswords.github.io/threeWordSchema.html"> Three Word Strategy</a>,
                    the adversary would need to steal approximately <b>five</b> of your passwords to be able to guess your password for a new website.

                Can I make my own password strategy?
                <div id="faq8" class="FAA">
                Yes! You can customize any of the password strategies that we propose to fit your own preferences. Furthermore, you can make your own
                    password strategy from scratch.

            </div>

            <div class="FAQ" onclick="toggle('faq9')">
                How should I use these strategies if the website name contains numbers or special characters?
                <div id="faq9" class="FAA">
                You can set your own rules for handling these cases. For example, you can either skip the non-letter characters
                    or assign all of them to a fixed letter or number (similar to wild card).
