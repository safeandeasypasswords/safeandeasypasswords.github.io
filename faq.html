                What is a password schema?
                <div id="faq1" class="FAA">
                Password schema is a mental algorithm that you can use to generate your passwords on the fly i.e., you don't need to memorize
                    passwords anymore! You can simply run these algorithms in your head with no need of paper, 
                    pencil or any computing device.
                    Click on <a href="http://safeandeasypasswords.github.io/threeWordSchema.html"> Three Word Schema </a> to see an example of
                    such a schema.

               Why should I use a password schema?
                <div id="faq2" class="FAA">
                Security of online information is summarized in passwords. The number of online accounts that we use is increasing
                    rapidly and memorizing different passwords is not feasible anymore. To avoid this difficulty, people either share
                    the same password between multiple accounts or they use password manager apps. It has been seen that both of these methods
                    are vulnerable to security threats. As a solution, we propose use of simple mental algorithms which we call password schemas.
                    Our algorithms have proven security guarantees.

            <div class="FAQ" onclick="toggle('faq3')">
                Do I need to memorize passwords for different websites?
                <div id="faq3" class="FAA">
                No! Everytime that you want to login to a website, you will generate/regenerate your password.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="FAQ" onclick="toggle('faq4')">
                What if I don't use a website for a few months? Will I still remember the password?
                <div id="faq4" class="FAA">
                You don't have to remember your password, you can easily regenerate it in your head.

            <div class="FAQ" onclick="toggle('faq5')">
                If I want to adopt a password schema, I should change all of my current passwords, this is a lot of effort!
                Why should I do this?
                <div id="faq5" class="FAA">
                We agree that the initial effort to adopt our password schemas might seem high. But, once you adopt it for your old accounts,
                    we promise that it will make your life much easier because of the following reasons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your passwords look like a random combination of letters/numbers and therefore it's very hard to crack.</li>
                        <li>You don't need to remember any of your passwords</li>
                        <li>You don't even need to know if you have an account with a website! Generate your password with your algorithm,
                            if it works, you have an account, otherwise create an account with the same password that you just generated.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you want to make a new account, you don't need to design a new password. Just give the name of the website/app 
                        as input to your algorithm and generate a password.
                        </li>
                        <li>No "forgot my password" anymore!</li>
                    </ul>

            </div>

            <div class="FAQ" onclick="toggle('faq6')">
                These schemas are public, what does guarantee that my passwords are secure?
                <div id="faq6" class="FAA">
                Although the schemas are public, your key is privately stored in your head. Remember that this is the only private information
                    that you should remember. We prove that, if you chose your key randomly (not based on your personal information),
                    your passwords are hard to crack.

            <div class="FAQ" onclick="toggle('faq7')">
                How difficult is it for an adversary to hack into my accounts?
                <div id="faq7" class="FAA">
                It depends on the schema that you use. For example,
                    if you use the <a href="http://safeandeasypasswords.github.io/threeWordSchema.html"> Three Word Schema </a>,
                    the adversary need to steal approximately <b>seven</b> of your passwords to be able to guess your password for a new website.
