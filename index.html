        <p>When was the last time that you wanted to login to a website or an app but you had forgotten your password?
        How many passwords did you unsuccessfully try in order to login?
        How many of these passwords have been used for other websites/apps?</p>

        <p>Do you know that XXX% of users use the same password for different websites,
        which make their passwords very vulnerable to hackersâ€™ attacks?
        Do you know that more than YYY% of the websites that we currently use do not securely store the passwords, making it easy for hackers to find our passwords and login to any other website that use the same or similar password?
        Have you ever been concerned about your online private information?</p>

        <p>If you are also concerned about the security of online private data, we have a solution for you.
        Based on more than 10 person-years of research at Carnegie Mellon University and Georgia Institute of Technology,
        we have designed a few password schemas that can help you to choose and remember more secure,
        yet easy to remember, passwords. Our focus has been on usability and security.
        Our password schemas help you to easily build a unique password for every different website, and easily remember it.
        With our methods, a third party will need to hack at least six different websites, before they can correctly guess all of your passwords.
        This is a significant increase in security compared to using a set of similar passwords for all the websites.</p>

       If you are interested to learn more, click here to for more details about our password schemas.</p>
